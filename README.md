# Julia in Astronomy & Astrophysics Research
### A Mini-Symposium at [JuliaCon 2022](https://juliacon.org/2022/)
### Monday, July 25, 2022
### Online 18:00-21:00 UTC (14:00 -17:00 EDT)

## Goals
This minisymposium aims to provide researchers in astronomers and astrophysicists an opportunity to share how Julia has enhanced their science and the challenges they encountered.  We aim to identify shared needs (e.g., opportunities for new/upgraded packages) that could significantly accelerate the adoption of Julia among the astronomical research community.  A secondary goal is to help strengthen the community of Julia developers active in astronomical research.

## Talks
- [Characterizing the TRAPPIST-1 system with Julia](abstracts/agol.md) (Eric Agol, University of Washington)
- [Back to Basics in Analyzing Radio Astronomy Data](abstracts/barrett.md) (Paul Barrett, The George Washington University)
- [Jointly Modeling Telluric Features and Stellar Variability with StellarSpectraObservationFitting.jl](abstracts/gilbertson.md) (Christian Gilbertson, Penn State)
- [Gradients of the Big Bang with Bolt.jl](abstracts/li.md) (Zack Li, Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics / University of Toronto)
- [High-dimensional inference from the Cosmic Microwave Background on GPU](abstracts/millea.md) (Marius Millea, University of California, Berkeley & Davis)
- [Adaptive Optics with Julia](abstracts/thompson.md) (William Thompson, University of Victoria)
- [Using Julia to build the simulation pipeline of an astronomical instrument](abstracts/tomasi.md) (Maurizio Tomasi, Universit√† degli Studi di Milano)
(Talk order still TBD)

## Panel discussion
We plan a joint Q&A session after the talks. Participants will be encouraged ask questions that draw from multiple speakers' experiences. 
[Eric Ford](https://www.personal.psu.edu/ebf11) (Penn State) will moderate the discussion. 

## How to participate
Please register for [JuliaCon 2022](https://juliacon.org/2022/) (no payment required!).  Then you'll be able to ask questions live via TBD.
