# Panel Discussion
## [Eric B. Ford](https://www.personal.psu.edu/ebf11) (Penn State, moderator)

The minisymposium will conclude with a joint Q&A session and panel discussion.  
Participants are encouraged to ask questions that draw from multiple speakers' experiences.

We aim to identify shared needs (e.g., opportunities for new/upgraded packages) that could significantly accelerate the adoption of Julia among the astronomical research community.  

Please submit/upvote questions/topics via [Pigeonhole](https://pigeonhole.at/JULIA13).
